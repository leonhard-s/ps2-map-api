"""Custom uvicorn-based server for hosting the API.

Uvicorn, the underlying server used for hosting the FastAPI app, does
not support programmatical shutoff or restart. Additionally, it expects
to be run in the main thread and will raise exceptions otherwise.

This module defines the ``ApiHost`` wrapper class which provides hooks
for starting and stopping the API server, as well as comunicating
between threads.
